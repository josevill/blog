description:
  After a decade since my last blog post, I am restarting. Looking to improve my content creation skills and for me to give something to the internet.

Feels like yesterday when I started blogging on Blogspot to publish some C++ patches for the eAthena (now [rAthena](https://github.com/rathena/rathena)) for Ragnar√∂k Online private game server files.

Feels like yesterday when I moved to Europe after more than 20 years living in Venezuela, with its cool people and all its struggles and hurdles.

Today, after 4 different positions, several dozens of projects and many job title changes, I am working as a [Technical Account Manager (TAM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9UjBBy0vEk) in Amazon Web Services in Dublin.

As of now, I have been working here the longest I've ever been in a single organization, normally you would see me leave due to getting bored of the projects I would be working or leading and would start looking for a different job with new challenges and new people, you gotta build that network!

Thanks for giving me an opportunity and reading my lines, hopefully I will beat procrastination for my personal projects and move this one forward.
